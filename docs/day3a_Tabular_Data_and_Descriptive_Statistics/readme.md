# Working with tabular data
In this chapter we will explore working with tabular data using the [pandas library](https://pandas.pydata.org/). We will explore tabular datasets, extract rows and columns from tables, eliminate NaNs and do basic descriptive statistics on measurements. We will also combine tables and manipulate them to make them easy to be grouped and have functions applied.

Some notebooks here are inspired from [material from Justin Bois](https://justinbois.github.io/dd-pol/2022/index.html).
