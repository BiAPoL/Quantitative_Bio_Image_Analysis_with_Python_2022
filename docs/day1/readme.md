# Day 1: Introduction to Python and Bio-image Analysis

Welcome to the Bio-Image Analysis Python ecosystem! In this chapter, we offer a broad overview of the bio-image analysis field using Python and napari. We start with some Python basics to get you confortable with Python syntax and teach you the main concepts necessary for image analysis. Then, we do the first step of any image analysis workflow: open and display images. For multi-dimensional data, we introduce you napari, a fast, interactive, multi-dimensional image viewer for Python.

After that, we start image processsing by teaching how image filters work and applying a few of them to reduce noise, background or enhance edges.
