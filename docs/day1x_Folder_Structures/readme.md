# Folder Structures

In this section, we will show a few folder structure examples and how to navigate through them via code. this is important when planning batch processing and/or when running machine learning algorithms. It is also good data management practice to have a simple folder structure to store images for sharing.

There are other structures possible not covered here, that may make more sense to your project. We show a few representative examples. Always consult a data management expert in advance to know the best option for you.
