# Make your own napari plugin

In this session we will make our own napari plugin using the [napari cookiecutter](https://github.com/napari/cookiecutter-napari-plugin).
We will first provide [annotations](https://realpython.com/lessons/annotations/) to a function to automatically generate a widget for napari using [magicgui](https://napari.org/magicgui/).
We will then append this small graphical user interface (GUI) to the napari viewer and run it. Lastly, we will use the [napari cookiecutter](https://github.com/napari/cookiecutter-napari-plugin) to create a template for our napari plugin, insert our GUI into it and upload it to GitHub.
