# Quantitative the Bio-Image Analysis with Python Course from BiA-PoL
From the Bio-Image Analysis Technology Development group, DFG Cluster of Excellence “Physics of Life”, TU Dresden

This repository hosts notebooks, information and data for the Quantitative the Bio-Image Analysis with Python Course 2022.

## Aims of the course

 This 5-day course will introduce you to the basics of image data science using Python, napari and Jupyter, enabling you to develop reproducible image analysis workflows using state-of-the art data science methods. This will allow you to differentiate objects such as cells with different phenotypes and quantify their properties such as shape, size, expression levels. Intermediate coding skills expected.

## Contents

This material is divided in 5 days (plus a day 0 for preparation of the programming environment).
```{tableofcontents}
- Day 0: Pre-install conda and configure virtual environment for the course.

- Day 1: A brief introduction to Bio-Image Analysis: from images to knowledge! Interactively explore your images in Jupyter notebooks, visualize 3D images with napari and start exploring image processing techniques like filtering with scikit-image.

- Day 2: A deeper plunge into the core concepts of image analysis with semantic and instance segmentation, and feature extraction. Powered with GPU acceleration!

- Day 3: Data science and biostatistics. Process tables of measurements using pandas in order to calculate and plot descriptive statistics and run unsupervised machine learning techniques for object classification and clustering.

- Day 4: Good scientific practice regarding code sustainability and usability, e.g., write code that you (and others) can still understand and use after 6 months. To help you distribute your code to others, you will learn how to create a napari plugin from a python function.

- Day 5: Bring your own data. We will help you to apply your new knowledge to your own data.
