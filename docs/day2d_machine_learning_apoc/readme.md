## Machine learning for object segmentation

In this chapter we will explore machine learning for object segmentation in microscopy images. We will explore the python libraries [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) and [apoc](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/apoc). Furthermore, we will use the napari plugin [napari-accelerated-pixel-and-object-classification](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-accelerated-pixel-and-object-classification) that makes apoc available to users with no coding skills.
