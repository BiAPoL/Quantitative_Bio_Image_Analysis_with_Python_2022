## Importing your fancy GUI to napari

Here, I modified a bit the GUI from the [previous post](https://biapol.github.io/blog/johannes_mueller/entry_user_interf2#creating-a-simple-gui-with-the-designer) and it looks like this:

![](images/flood_tool_gui.png)

You can find the '.ui' file to open this GUI with the designer [here](scripts/flood_tool.ui). Download it and save it to the same folder of your code.

Now let's add it to napari! Modify the script as shown below:

```Python
import napari
from skimage.io import imread
from qtpy.QtWidgets import QMainWindow
from qtpy import uic
from pathlib import Path

# Define the main window class
class FancyGUI(QMainWindow):
    def __init__(self, napari_viewer):          # include napari_viewer as argument (it has to have this name)
        super().__init__()
        self.viewer = napari_viewer
        self.UI_FILE = str(Path(__file__).parent / "flood_tool.ui")  # path to .ui file
        uic.loadUi(self.UI_FILE, self)           # load QtDesigner .ui file

viewer = napari.Viewer()
napari_image = imread('21_Map_of_Tabuaeran_Kiribati_blue.png')      # Reads an image from file
viewer.add_image(napari_image, name='napari_island')                # Adds the image to the viewer and give the image layer a name

flood_widget = FancyGUI(viewer)                                     # Create instance from our class
viewer.window.add_dock_widget(flood_widget, area='right')           # Add our gui instance to napari viewer
```

This code does:
* Define a class that initializes your GUI (named 'FancyGUI' in this case);
* Pass the napari viewer as an argument to this class (with `def __init__(self, napari_viewer):`);
* Import and applies your GUI (with `uic.loadUi(self.UI_FILE, self)`);
* Add an instance of this class to the viewer (`viewer.window.add_dock_widget(flood_widget, area='right')`).

When you run the script, you should see the screen below:

It is now embedded into napari! Sweet üç¨!

If you want to update your GUI layout, let's say, by changing a button color, you can go back to designer, select the button and fill the `styleSheet` field by clicking on `...`:

![](images/designer_stylesheet0.png)

and choosing colors (background, border, etc) by clicking on the small arrowhead next to "Add color":

![](images/designer_stylesheet.png)

It will add a line with the chosen color in [CSS syntax](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_syntax.asp). Many lines can be added (each ending with `;`) to further elaborate the style.

## Creating a callback function

As you may have noticed, our GUI is there, but it does nothing yet. We need to link click/change events to callback functions.
Just for fun, let's create a function that relates temperature increases to sea level.

***Disclaimer:** This specific function, although based on the fact that global warming contributes to increase sea levels, has no scientific background to support it, and it was completely made-up just for a fun illustration. Climate change is a complex subject that involves many internal and external factors which I do not have the expertise to explain.*

```Python
def flood(image, delta):
    new_level = delta*85
    label_image = image <= new_level
    label_image = label_image.astype(int)*13     # label number 13 is blue in napari
    return(label_image, new_level)
```

This function takes an `image` and a `delta` (temperature) as inputs. It converts delta into `new_level` (new sea level) and creates a label image where the labeled region corresponds to grayscale levels which are below `new_level`. It returns `label_image` and `new_level`. It can be simplified, but let's keep it like this for future reasons.

Now, we need to link this function to the 'Apply' button. This can be done with the general command `pushButton.clicked.connect(callback_function)`.
Let's write a callback function that calls our flood function:

```Python
def apply_delta(self):
    label, level = flood(image, delta)
```

We now have to specify to our callback where it gets the variables `image` and `delta`.
* `image` is the input image layer in napari, so let's store it as a numpy array with `image = self.viewer.layers['napari_island'].data`;
* `delta` is the input value inside the Spinbox widget, so let's get it with `delta = self.doubleSpinBox.value()`;
* `label` is the output label image, we have to add it to the viewer with `self.viewer.add_labels(label)`;
* `level` is the output sea level, which we want also to show as our Slider widget, so we set it with `self.horizontalSlider.setValue(level)`.

Lastly, we use a flag (`self.label_layer`) to update the label layer rather than creating a new one every time. The code now looks like this:

```Python
import napari
from skimage.io import imread
from qtpy.QtWidgets import QMainWindow
from qtpy import uic
from pathlib import Path

def flood(image, delta):
    new_level = delta*85
    label_image = image <= new_level
    label_image = label_image.astype(int)*13  # label 13 is blue in napari
    return(label_image, new_level)

# Define the main window class
class FancyGUI(QMainWindow):
    def __init__(self, napari_viewer):          # include napari_viewer as argument (it has to have this name)
        super().__init__()
        self.viewer = napari_viewer
        self.UI_FILE = str(Path(__file__).parent / "flood_tool.ui")  # path to .ui file
        uic.loadUi(self.UI_FILE, self)           # load QtDesigner .ui file

        self.label_layer = None                # stored label layer variable
        self.pushButton.clicked.connect(self.apply_delta)

    def apply_delta(self):
        image = self.viewer.layers['napari_island'].data    # We chose to use the layer name to find the correct image layer
        delta = self.doubleSpinBox.value()
        label, level = flood(image, delta)
        if self.label_layer is None:
            self.label_layer = self.viewer.add_labels(label)
        else:
            self.label_layer.data = label
        self.horizontalSlider.setValue(level)

viewer = napari.Viewer()
napari_image = imread('21_Map_of_Tabuaeran_Kiribati_blue.png')    # Reads an image from file
viewer.add_image(napari_image, name='napari_island')              # Adds the image to the viewer and give the image layer a name

flood_widget = FancyGUI(viewer)                                          # Create instance from our class
viewer.window.add_dock_widget(flood_widget, area='right')                  # Add our gui instance to napari viewer
```

Now when we increase the tempearture and click Apply, the island starts to flood :cold_sweat::ocean::

## Automatically creating a GUI from a function with magicgui

What if we could 'magically' simplify all that and just say: 'Dear computer, please create a GUI for my function'?
We can ~~literally~~ almost do that with üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è[magicgui](https://napari.org/magicgui/index.html)! If we put some annotations right next to the variables in our function, we can create the GUI with one line of code üòª ! So let's not wait any longer and add those annotations to our function:

```Python
from napari.types import ImageData, LabelsData

def flood(image: ImageData, delta: float = 0, new_level: int = 0) -> LabelsData: 
    new_level = delta*85
    label_image = image <= new_level
    label_image = label_image.astype(int)*13 # label 13 is blue in napari
    return(label_image)
```

Here we are specifying that:
* `image` is data from a napari image layer (`ImageData`);
* `delta` is `float`;
* `new_level` is `integer`;
* output `label_image` will hold data from a napari labels layer (`LabelsData`).

You may have noticed that we placed `new_level` as input instead of output. That's because magicgui creates widgets (like buttons, sliders, etc) based on the input variables.

Now, here it comes... the one-liner: ü•Åü•Å

`flood_widget = magicgui(flood)`

Done! GUI was created and stored in `flood_widget`. The full code and the result become like this:

```Python
import napari
from skimage.io import imread
from magicgui import magicgui
from napari.types import ImageData, LabelsData

def flood(image: ImageData, delta: float=0, new_level: int=0) -> LabelsData: 
    new_level = delta*85
    label_image = image <= new_level
    label_image = label_image.astype(int)*13 # label 13 is blue in napari
    return(label_image)

viewer = napari.Viewer()
napari_image = imread('21_Map_of_Tabuaeran_Kiribati_blue.png')    # Reads an image from file
viewer.add_image(napari_image, name='napari_island')              # Adds the image to the viewer and give the image layer a name 

flood_widget = magicgui(flood)                                    # Create GUI with magicgui
viewer.window.add_dock_widget(flood_widget, area='right')         # Add our gui instance to napari viewer
```

<img alt="figure 3" id="figure3" src="images/napari_flood_tool3.png" />

Neat! Just a couple of things missing though. We only get Spinboxes now, what about the Slider? Don't worry, we can fix this still maintaining the "one-liner", although a bigger one now üò¨ . We can add widget options as python dictionaries, like this:

```Python
flood_widget = magicgui(flood, delta={'label': 'Temperature Increase (Œî¬∞C):', 
                                           'min': 0, 'max' : 3, 'step': 0.1},
                                new_level={'label':'Sea Level (dm):', 'widget_type':'Slider',
                                           'min': 0, 'max' : 255, 'enabled' : False},
                                auto_call=True)
```

Now, you get practically the same result as the earlier approach. If you don't know the widget options, take a look [here](https://napari.org/magicgui/usage/widget_overview.html) to find the widget you want and discover more about its parameters.
We discarded the button here by using `auto_call=True`. This means that the callback function will be executed whenever the user change any of the inputs. This results in a smoother usability, but be careful, because if the callback function is too slow, it may get called several times before returning, which can lead to frozen screens.

<img alt="figure 4" id="figure4" src="images/napari_flood_tool4.png" />

One thing missing is that the 'Sea level' slider does not get updated since it is an input now. But, we can append a callback function to the spibox that updates the slider every time delta changes! Add the following code after creating the widget with magicgui (thanks Talley Lambert for this tip!):

```
@flood_widget.delta.changed.connect  # Connect a function to delta (spinbox widget)
def update_level(delta: float):
    flood_widget.new_level.value = delta * 85  # Update slider when spinbox changes
```

You can look for further documentation and tutorials at [magicgui quickstart](https://napari.org/magicgui/usage/quickstart.html) and [magicgui in napari](https://napari.org/guides/stable/magicgui.html).

## Creating a GUI from FunctionGui

The third approach is a more straightforward one. By using and modifying FunctionGui (the type that is returned by magicgui), we can have a more direct access to all options.

We keep the annotated version of our function, but instead of passing it to magicgui, we will define a new `FunctionGui` class, based on [this example](https://napari.org/guides/stable/magicgui.html#magicgui-widgets-functiongui) and pass our flood function to `FunctionGui`. So, I will start with the code shown below:

```Python
def flood(image: ImageData, delta: float=0, new_level: int=0) -> LabelsData: 
    new_level = delta*85
    label_image = image <= new_level
    label_image = label_image.astype(int)*13 # label 13 is blue in napari
    return(label_image)
    
class MyGui(FunctionGui):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(
          flood,                # Here is where we pass our custom annotated function to FunctionGui
          call_button=True,
          layout='vertical',
          param_options={}
        )
        # do whatever other initialization you want here
```

If we open napari, add our image and add MyGui to napari, we get the same result as shown [before](#figure3) (full code at the end of this section).

Similarly, to match the widgets style we want (like in [previous results](#figure4)), we can provide dictionnaires to the `param_options`, like this:

```Python
class MyGui(FunctionGui):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(
          flood,                # Here is where we pass our custom annotated function to FunctionGui
          call_button=True,
          layout='vertical',
          param_options={'delta':
                             {'label': 'Temperature Increase (Œî¬∞C):', 
                              'min': 0, 'max' : 3, 'step': 0.1},
                        'new_level':
                            {'label':'Sea Level (dm):', 'widget_type':'Slider',
                             'min': 0, 'max' : 255, 'step' : 1}}
        )
        # do whatever other initialization you want here
```

We can modify the `__init()__` and the `__call()__` functions to gain access to other widgtes and get/send other variables that are not images. For example, besides `label_image`, we can make our function return `new_level` again as an annotation and use its value to change the slider when the user hits the 'Run' button. Check the complete code and result below:

```Python
import napari
from skimage.io import imread
from napari.types import ImageData, LabelsData, LayerDataTuple
from magicgui.widgets import FunctionGui

def flood(image: ImageData, delta: float=0, new_level: int=0) -> LayerDataTuple:
    new_level = delta*85
    label_image = image <= new_level
    label_image = label_image.astype(int)*13 # label 13 is blue in napari
    return((label_image, {'name': 'flood result','metadata': {'new_level':new_level}}))

class MyGui(FunctionGui):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(
          flood,
          call_button=False,
          auto_call=True,
          layout='vertical',
          param_options={'delta':
                             {'label': 'Temperature Increase (Œî¬∞C):',
                              'min': 0, 'max' : 3, 'step': 0.1},
                        'new_level':
                            {'label':'Sea Level (dm):', 'widget_type':'Slider',
                             'min': 0, 'max' : 255, 'enabled' : False}}
        )

    def __call__(self):
        label_image = super().__call__()
        new_level = round(label_image[1]['metadata']['new_level'])
        self.new_level.value = new_level


napari_image = imread('21_Map_of_Tabuaeran_Kiribati_blue.png')
viewer = napari.Viewer()
viewer.add_image(napari_image, name='napari_island')

flood_widget = MyGui()
viewer.window.add_dock_widget(flood_widget, area='right')
```

## Conclusion

We have implemented our GUI in 3 different ways! Check which way is advantageous for you and play with it a little bit, because in the next part we will teach you how to turn it into a napari plugin and distribute it üéâ
