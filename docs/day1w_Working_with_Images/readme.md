# Opening and Displaying with Images in Python

In this section, we will show you how to open images in python and a few ways to display them in a jupyter notebook. We start with [imread function from scikit-image.io](https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/api/skimage.io.html#skimage.io.imread), which can open standard image formats like '.tif' and '.png'. Then we show how ways to display images side-by-side in a single figure. Finally, we show you how to work with multichannel images and an example with proprietary formats. As a bonus part, we also show how to install an additional python package to an existing conda environment.
