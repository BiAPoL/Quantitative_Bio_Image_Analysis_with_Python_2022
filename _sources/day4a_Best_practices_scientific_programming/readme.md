## Exercise: Software quality indicators

Visit the following github pages and judge if the published open source tools are well documented, sustainably maintained, and openly supported. 
Would you use them for your science project?

* https://github.com/MouseLand/cellpose
* https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-webcam
* https://github.com/RoccoDAnt/napari-zelda

## Exercise: Collaborative script editing

For this session we do an excursion to a Focal Plane blog post about [Collaborative Script Editing with git](https://focalplane.biologists.com/2021/09/04/collaborative-bio-image-analysis-script-editing-with-git/). 
We will go through the procedure demonstrated there and create a [github repository](https://github.com) and share it with our neighbors.
