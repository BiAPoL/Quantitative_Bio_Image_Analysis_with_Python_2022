# Day 2: Image Filtering, Segmentation and Feature Extraction

On day 2 we will process images using filters for denoising and background removal. 
We will also segment nuclei and cells in images using classical approaches, machine learning and deep learning.
Last but not lease we will extract quantitative measurements from images.
