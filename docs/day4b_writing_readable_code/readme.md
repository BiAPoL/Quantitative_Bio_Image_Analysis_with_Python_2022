# Writing readable code
In this session we will learn how to write readable code. 
We will learn why scientific programmers follow rules such as 
* [Prevent magic numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)),
* [Don't repeat yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself),
* Don't write [Spaghetti code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code),
* [Divide and rule](https://www.quora.com/What-is-divide-and-conquer-programming-strategy) and
* [Keep it simple and short](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)
