# Introduction to Bio-image Analysis
In this session we will introduce concepts and terms of image data science in the bio-imaging and microscopy context. We focus on the scientific cycle going from observation, via an experiment, through image data analysis, modeling and towards the next experiment. We introduce terms such as quantitative, objective, reliability, reproducibility and repeatability.
