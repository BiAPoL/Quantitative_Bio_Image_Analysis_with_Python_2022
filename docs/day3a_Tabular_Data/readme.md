# Working with tabular data
In this chapter we will explore working with tabular data using the [pandas library](https://pandas.pydata.org/). We will explore tabular datasets, extract rows and columns from tables, eliminate NaNs and do basic descriptive statistics on measurements. Last but not least we will visualize tables in napari and visualize quantiative measurements from table columns in image space.
