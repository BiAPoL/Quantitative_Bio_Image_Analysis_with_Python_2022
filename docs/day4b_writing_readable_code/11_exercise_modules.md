# Modularization exercise

Go through the code from yesterday and identify a workflow that worked well and contained these steps:

* Image preprocessing
* Image segmentation
* Feature extraction

Copy & paste code from the notebooks you worked with yesterday into a new custom module `my_analysis.py`. Write a new notebook that demonstrates how to use the functions of your `my_analysis module`.
